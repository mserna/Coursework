/*
* MUST HAVE PROPS FOR SUCCESSFUL BLOCKCHAIN
* 1. Decentralizaiton - no single entity is responsible for the data (not one has control of all the processing)
* 	a. Architectural - How many nodes are in system and how does it handle fault tolerance
*	b. Political - How many orgs or peeps control how many nodes
*	c. Logical - Does interface/data structure look like swarm or single monolithic object 
*	 	ie. Cut system and half, do both halves continue to run independently
* 2. Immutability - a write only state (once the data is written, it cannot be updated)
* 
* Main actors invovled in blockchain:
* 1. Miners - provide CPU power and act as Gateway to immutable data store. [Can we get rid of this or change?]
* 2. Users -  Writes and reads to data store. Dependent on miners for CPU power [We need this out to perform dependency]
